# Understanding API Security Best Practices

API security is critical in modern web applications. Let's explore the best practices to keep your APIs safe.

## Common API Vulnerabilities

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration
- Rate Limiting bypass
- Authentication flaws

## Security Measures

### Authentication
Always implement proper authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens.

### Rate Limiting
Protect your API from abuse by implementing rate limiting on endpoints.

### Input Validation
Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

### HTTPS Only
Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

### CORS Configuration
Carefully configure CORS headers to allow only trusted origins.

Implementing these practices will significantly improve your API's security posture.
